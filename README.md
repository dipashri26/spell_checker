# spell_checker
Here's a short algorithm for spell checker:

1. Initialization:
   - Set up a Tkinter GUI with a spellchecker.

2. Check and Correct:
   - Spell-check the user's input sentence.
   - Display the correction and store the entry if it was corrected.

3. Spelling Correction:
   - Tokenize and correct the sentence using a spellchecker.

4. Update Previous Entries:
   - Limit stored entries to 5.
   - Update the display with original and corrected sentences.

5. Clear Entries:
   - Clear the list of previous entries and update the display.

6. Main Execution:
   - Instantiate and run the Tkinter app.

7. Execution:
   - Run the script, enter a sentence, and observe the spell-checking functionality.

Note: Ensure the code has the correct typos fixed (`__init__` and `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
